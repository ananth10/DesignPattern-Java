What is Prototype?

->We have a complex object that is costly to create. To create more instances of class, we use
an existing instance as our prototype

->Prototype will allow us to make copies of existing object & save us from having to recreate objects from scratch.

->We start by creating a class which will be a prototype
  1. This class must implement Cloneable interface
  2. Class should override clone method and return copy itself.
  3. Clone method implementation should consider the deep&shallow copy and choose whichever applicable
