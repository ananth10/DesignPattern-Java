Creational design pattern

-> Creational design patterns deal with the process of creation objects of class.
-> When we create an object there might be many steps are involved like reading from api or querying database before
creating final object of a class
-> There will be one network configuration file for an whole application so that we need to create that config file with many
other attributes with it.

Types:

-> Builder
-> Simple factory
-> Factory method
-> Prototype
-> Singleton
-> Abstract Factory
-> Object pool
