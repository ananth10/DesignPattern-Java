Dependency Inversion Principle

1. High level modules should not depend upon low level modules.
both should be depend upon abstractions.

2. Abstraction should not depend upon details.
but details should be depend upon abstraction

High level module:

-> Basically means a module that provides or implement business rules, that is what we write.

Low level module:

-> Basically a functionality that is so basic that can be used anywhere, eg. writingToDisc and eg. converting java class into json object
