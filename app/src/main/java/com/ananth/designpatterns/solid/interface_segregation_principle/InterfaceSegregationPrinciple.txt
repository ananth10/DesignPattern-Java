Interface Segregation Principle

1. Client/Class should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

Mostly called Interface Pollution

->Which means making one big interface will many methods and implement that interface across all classes
where some methods are really not required.

Signs of interface pollution

->Classes have empty method implementation
->Method implementation throws UnsupportedOperationException
->Method implementation return null or default values.
